Python

- Built on C, can do everything in python that you can do in C
- Weakly typed language - var is assigned a type when its first used
- Var is of any type, and as soon as you assign a value, the var gets a type

- All identifiers in python are references.
- Everything is pass by reference. Special equality tests:
  > x is y
  > x == y

- popen calls popen in C. C forks, creates pipes and waits. Read contents of stdout.

uu encode
- add -xzvf to zip as well
- tar -cvf compress.tar hello

> want to take input from stdin ( - ) dash
                            |
cat compress.tar | uuencode - > payload
                              |---- redirect output

- ASCII safe binary file

- Extract file using uudecode

$ uudecode -p payload | tar -xvf -

- Useful in installer script

{
bash code/python code


some special characters (###PAYLOAD)
[stuff to decode]

}
- grep itself for payload, cut the bottom of file
- in installer script grep for the special character keywords tail
- then pipe that into uudecode

- Describe readme buttons and how to use
- Use append arrow while writing to bashrc, dont overwrite
  cat x >> .bashrc instead of cat x > bashrc

- wrap exectuable in shell script
- ask for home dir in script to build absolute path

$ export codemonloc = $(pwd)
  in script: cd $codemonloc
          java Codemon

          java -cp codemon

- makefile rule should be a path ./obj/objfile.o: deps

%vpath .c src
`--- any file .c is inside the src folder

variables-
  SRC = $(wildcard*.c)
  INC = $(SRC, prepend Include/)

  how to get all c files in a var

- Establishing precedence in yacc, brackets before mult, befroe add etc.

expr = (expr) | expr2

expr2 = expr * expr | expr3
.
.
.
expr3 = number;

- yacc is right recursive, so put the last one at the end

- resetting parser, begin0 resets lex, yywrap
